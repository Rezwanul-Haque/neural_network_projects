# What is Diabetes?
### Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that is associated with elevated blood sugar levels in the body. Diabetes often leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney damage, and long-term damage to the extremities (that is, limbs and eyes).


# Consequences of Diabetes?
### It is estimated that there are 415 million people in the world suffering from diabetes, with up to 5 million deaths every year attributed to diabetes-related complications. In the United States, diabetes is estimated to be the seventh highest cause of death. Clearly, diabetes is a cause of concern to the wellbeing of modern society.


# Types of Diabetes?
## Diabetes can be divided into two subtypes: type 1 and type 2. 

### Type 1 diabetes results from the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin. Type 1 diabetes is relatively rare compared to type 2 diabetes, and it only accounts for approximately 5% of diabetes. Unfortunately, the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown and therefore, it is difficult to prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes.

### Type 2 diabetes results from the body's gradual resistance to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the prevalent form of diabetes in the world, and it is caused by excessive body weight, irregular exercise, and a poor diet. Fortunately, the onset of type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed if diagnosed early.


# Usefulness of predicting diabetes early?
### early detection and diagnosis of diabetes is that the early stages of diabetes are often non-symptomatic. People who are on the path to diabetes (also known as prediabetes) often do not know that they have diabetes until it is too late.

# Machine learning to address Diabetes problem?
### If we have a labeled dataset that contains some vital measurements of patients (for example, age and blood insulin level), as well as a true label indicating the onset of diabetes in the patient sometime after the measurements were taken, then we can train a neural network (machine learning classifier) on this data and use it to make predictions on new patients.

# According to experts, AI in healthcare will see the most growth in the following areas
    1. Automated Diagnosis
    2. Robot-Assisted Surgeries
    3. Precision Medicine
    4. Virtual Health Assistants
    
# Automated Diagnosis
## For predicting Diabetes, this project fall under the these category of Automated Diagnosis.
#### Currently, most medical diagnosis is performed by skilled medical experts. In the case of medical diagnosis through images (such as X-rays and MRI scans), skilled radiologists are required to provide their expertise in the diagnostic process. These skilled medical professionals go through years of rigorous training before being certified, and there is a shortage of these medical experts in certain countries, which contributes to poor outcomes. The role of AI is to augment these experts and to offload lowlevel routine diagnosis, which can be done by an AI agent with a high degree of accuracy.

# Dataset Description
### The Pima Indians diabetes dataset consists of diagnostic measurements collected from a sample of female Pima Indians, along with a label indicating whether the patient developed diabetes within five years of the initial measurement.
